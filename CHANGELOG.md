## [Unreleased]

Under construction

## [0.3.1-alpha.0] - 2022-09-01

- `conditions` and `context` to `ReencryptionRequest` with python/wasm bindings to expose them.
- `conditions` to `MessageKit` and `RetrievalKit` with python/wasm bindings to expose them.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-08-16

### Changed

- Bumped `umbral-pre` to 0.6, and the nested dependencies accordingly. ([#17])
- Following the changes in `umbral-pre` 0.6, the types that were `serde`-serialized in human readable formats as hex will now have a `"0x"` prefix. ([#17])


### Added

- `Eq` marker for `HRAC` and `FleetStateChecksum`. ([#17])
- Python typing stubs. ([#20])
- The Python module `nucypher_core.umbral` now exports `KeyFrag`. ([#20])
- `Display` impl for `HRAC` and `FleetStateChecksum`, and exposed it in the Python and WASM bindings. ([#22])

## [0.2.0] - 2022-04-24

### Changed

- Changed from `sha3_256` to `Keccak` when building `FleetState` and `HRAC`. ([#15])


[#15]: https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-core/pull/15


## [0.1.1] - 2022-03-15

### Fixed

- `umbral-pre` bumped to 0.5.2 and `k256` bumped to 0.10.4 to make use of an important bugfix (see https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/issues/529). Previous 0.1.* versions (using `k256` 0.10.2 with the bug) are yanked.


## [0.1.0] - 2022-03-14

### Changed

- Renamed `staker_address` to `staking_provider_address` in `NodeMetadataPayload` fields and `RevocationOrder::new` parameters. ([#10])
- Renamed `NodeMetadataPayload.decentralized_identity_evidence` to `operator_signature`. ([#10])
- Declared `NodeMetadataPayload.operator_signature` as `recoverable::Signature` instead of just a byte array. This allows the user to detect an invalid signature on `NodeMetadata` creation. ([#11])
- Renamed `NodeMetadataPayload.certificate_bytes` to `certificate_der` (although it is not deserialized on the Rust side, so the DER format is not strictly enforced). ([#13])
- Changed some method and field names in WASM bindings to conform to JS style (camel case). New names are: `TreasureMap.publisherVerifyingKey`, `TreasureMap.bobVerifyingKey`, `TreasureMap.encryptedKfrag`, `RetrievalKit.queriedAddresses`, `RevocationOrder.verifySignature`, `NodeMetadataPayload.verifyingKey`, `NodeMetadataPayload.encryptingKey`, `NodeMetadataPayload.timestampEpoch`, `MetadataRequest.announceNodes`. ([#9])
- Moved `ADDRESS_SIZE` to `Address::SIZE`. ([#14])
- `MetadataResponse::verify()` and `ReencryptionResponse::verify()` return a `Result` instead of `Option`. ([#14])
- Renamed `RevocationOrder::verify_signature()` to `verify()` and made it return a `Result<(Address, EncryptedKeyFrag)>`. ([#14])


### Added

- `TreasureMap::make_revocation_orders()` (with the corresponding methods in Python and WASM bindings). ([#9])
- `HRAC.fromBytes()` in WASM bindings ([#9]), and in Python bindings ([#14]).
- `RevocationOrder.stakingProviderAddress` in WASM bindings. ([#9])
- `MetadataResponse.verify()` in WASM bindings. ([#9])
- `impl From<[u8; 16]>` for `HRAC`. ([#9])
- Made `RevocationOrder.staking_provider_address` public. ([#9]) Rolled back in ([#14]) in favor of the return value from `verify()`.
- `HRAC::SIZE` constant ([#14])
- `VerificationError` for use in various `verify()` methods. ([#14])


### Fixed

- Some methods in WASM bindings that were previously taking `self` are now taking `&self`, leading to a more idiomatic behavior in JS. ([#9])

## [0.0.4] - 2022-02-09

### Changed

- Changed "worker" to "operator" in the API, according to the new terminology. ([#5])


[#5]: https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-core/pull/5

## [0.0.3] - 2022-02-03

### Fixed

- Added the manifest to the Python bindings package, fixing the source distribution build.


## [0.0.2] - 2022-01-25

### Changed

- `umbral-pre` dependency bumped to 0.5 (and to match it, MSRV to 1.56, and Rust edition to 2021). The API was updated accordingly (mainly due to the no-clone approach). Note that this changes the ABI as well. ([#4])
- `NodeMetadataPayload.decentralized_identity_evidence` is now a fixed-sized array in the serialized metadata. ([#2])
- `k256` dependency bumped to 0.10, and `umbral-pre` to 0.5. ([#2])
- `NodeMetadataPayload.canonical_address` and the parameter `ursula_address` of `RevocationOrder::new()` are renamed to `staker_address`. ([#2])


### Added

- WASM bindings. ([#1])
- `NodeMetadataPayload::derive_worker_address()` method. ([#2])
